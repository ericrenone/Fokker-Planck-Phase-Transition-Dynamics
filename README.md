# Fokker-Planck Phase-Transition Dynamics in ML & AGI

---

## Fokker-Planck Overview

This repository implements a **Fokker-Planck-inspired framework** for modeling **phase-transition dynamics in autonomous latent systems**. The architecture bridges **Information Theory**, **Statistical Mechanics**, and **Latent Representation Learning**.

The system models the evolution of a probability density  over a high-dimensional manifold, governed by the interaction between **Drift (Inference)** and **Diffusion (Substrate Noise)**.

## Fokker-Planck Canonical Components

The simulation maps classical stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) primitives:

| Component | Fokker-Planck Analogy | ML/AGI Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S1 (Inference)** | Drift term  | Directed updates toward low-uncertainty/high-utility states. |
| **S2 (Substrate)** | Diffusion term  | Stochastic exploration, memory persistence, and hardware noise. |
| **Transport** | Flux  | Wasserstein-like redistribution of information mass. |
| **Gating** | Nonlinear Potential  | Regulatory constraints preventing gradient explosion. |
| **Synthesis** | Stationary Distribution  | Emergent latent manifold; the agent's consolidated "world model." |
| **Phase Transitions** | Stochastic Resets | Rapid structural adaptation to escape local minima. |

## Fokker-Planck Mathematical Framework

The system evolves according to the **Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE)**, describing the time-evolution of the latent state distribution:

### 1. Entropy-Driven Drift ()

The drift velocity  is coupled to the gradient of Shannon entropy, . This represents the system's drive toward **Knowledge Consolidation**:


### 2. Diffusive Substrate Dynamics ()

The diffusion coefficient  represents the inherent "temperature" of the substrate, enabling **Stochastic Exploration** and preventing overfitting to local optima.

### 3. Emergent Latent Manifold ()

As , the interaction between  and  reaches a steady state. The resulting distribution  represents the **Autonomous Consolidation** of all processed information.

## Fokker-Planck Simulation Features

* **Phase-Transition "Broken Gates":** Stochastic resets model "Opportunity Windows." During these events, gating potentials are lowered, allowing the system to undergo rapid self-organization and structural restructuring.
* **Hyperbolic Latent Mapping:** High-dimensional states are projected onto a **Poincaré Disk**. This illustrates how concepts cluster based on semantic proximity within the hyperbolic space.
* **Information Flux Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of the balance between information gain (drift) and entropy production (diffusion).

## Fokker-Planck Analytical Takeaways

> **Key Insight:** In AGI systems, "Intelligence" can be viewed as the optimization of the Drift-Diffusion ratio.

* **Information Consolidation:** S1 reduces uncertainty via entropy gradient descent. The consolidation ratio quantifies learning efficiency.
* **Substrate Resilience:** S2 maintains the "diversity" of the latent space, ensuring the system can adapt to new out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
* **Self-Organization:**  represents the stationary distribution where the system has successfully "modeled" its environment.
* **Phase Transitions:** Rapid adaptation events (resets) are necessary to shift between vastly different knowledge regimes.
